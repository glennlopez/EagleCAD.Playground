Gerber Playground
=================
This is where I host all my gerber files that are non-project related. Most are trials, some are personal mini projects, others eventually make it to become its own larger project which are then moved into its own repository never to be seen here ever again.

>The Gerber format is an open 2D bi-level vector image file format. It is the de facto standard used by printed circuit board (PCB) industry software to describe the printed circuit board images: copper layers, solder mask, legend, drill holes, etc.
